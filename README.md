# Open Bounds

## Repository of progress on mathematical unknowns

This is a collaborative effort to compile data on historical progress on solved and unsolved mathematical problems. The focus is on quantitative updates, such as the lower and upper bounds on the value of special numbers.

This site provides browsing, visualizations, and access to the structured data for other uses.
