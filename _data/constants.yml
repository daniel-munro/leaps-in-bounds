  description: "The Ramsey number $R(4,4)$ represents the smallest number $n$ such that any two-coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ must contain either a monochromatic $K_4$ in the first color or a monochromatic $K_4$ in the second color."

  description: "The Ramsey number $R(4,5)$ represents the smallest number $n$ such that any two-coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ must contain either a monochromatic $K_4$ in the first color or a monochromatic $K_5$ in the second color."

  description: "The Ramsey number $R(4,6)$ represents the smallest number $n$ such that any two-coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ must contain either a monochromatic $K_4$ in the first color or a monochromatic $K_6$ in the second color."
