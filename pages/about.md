# About

Leaps in Bounds was created and organized by [Daniel Munro](https://danmun.ro).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/daniel-munro/leaps-in-bounds).

The data on bounds and value updates are compiled from many sources, and the primary and secondary sources are cited whenever possible.

<span class="badge text-bg-warning">Note</span> The histories of constants shown here are not necessarily complete. This applies to current best bounds or exact values, as well as updates prior to the current best ones. Further contributions to this repository will fill in missing updates.
